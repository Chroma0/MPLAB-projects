## Requirements
### Basic
- Use four bulbs as a counter to record the degree of rotation of the variable 
resistor, when the variable resistor is rotated, the form of the light bulb is 
sequentially changed to indicate 0~15 in binary. Please use 10-bit resolution 
and map 0~1023 to 0~15, the oscillator frequency needs to be >= 4 MHz. 
### Advance
- Use four bulbs to indicate 0~9. Please light up the bulb while rotating the 
variable resistor at a constant speed to show your student ID, only the 
numerical part is needed. If your student ID is P74101214, your bulbs will 
light up in sequence in binary: 7, 4, 1, 0, 1, 2, 1, 4.
### Bonus
- Use a variable resistor to implement a dimming LED. Please adjust the 
PWM duty cycle by rotating the variable resistor.
