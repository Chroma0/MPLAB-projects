## Requirements
### Basic
- The following program "main.c" will call the "is_square" function to check if an input 
number is a square number or not. Please complete the "is_square" function with PIC18F 
assembly language. The input of "is_square" function will be an 8-bit unsigned integer. The 
return value will be either 0x01 if the input integer is a square number or 0xFF if the input 
integer is not a square number. The result will be stored in an unsigned char named 'ans.' 
Please be aware that you will need two files, 'main.c' and 'is_square.asm,' to fulfill this 
requirement.
### Advance
- The following program "main.c" will call the "multi_signed " function to finish the signed 
multiplication. Please complete the "multi_signed" function with PIC18F assembly language. 
The "multi_signed " function takes an 8-bit signed char 洧눅 and a 4-bit signed char 洧눆 as inputs 
and returns an unsigned int res which represents the result of the multiplication of 洧눅 and 洧눆. 
The output will be a 16-bit result. The result should be stored in an unsigned int variable, then 
show it in the WATCHes. Please note that the signed data will be formatted in two's 
complement.
### Bonus
- Given an 8-bit unsigned integer 洧눅 and an 8-bit unsigned integer 洧눆, please complete the "lcm" 
function with PIC18F assembly language. The function returns a 16-bit unsigned integer that 
represents the least common multiple of 洧눅 and 洧눆.
